[WIP] part_counting
==============================

Two approaches are proposed to counting parts in an RGBD image. The goal is to properly estimate the amount of parts, all of the same geometry, in a steel box. All images were generated through renders of simulations, using blender.

One approach is to use computer vision "traditional" techniques to achieve the estimate. Registration algorithms are used to "dig" the part's geometry from the surface measured (depth channel).

The other is to use straightforward deep learning (convolutional encoder with fully-connected decoder). The problem is easily framed as a superviserd learning, regression task.
